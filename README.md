## Quick installation
HealthFog uses a master-slave design as shown in the figure above. To setup HealthFog in your fog environment follow these steps:
Requirements: You need atleast two windows/linux systems with python 3. Follow the following steps in each fog node (master and worker):
1. Install xampp in windows or use <i>fogbus-install-generic.sh script</i> in Install-scripts folder.
2. Clone HealthFog repo at C:/xampp/htdocs/ (in windows) or var/www/html/ (in linux).
3. Change directory to the HealthFog repo folder.
4. Run ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```.
5. Change directory to HeartModel folder and run ```python3 MasterInterface.py```.
Follow these steps in master node:
1. Update config.txt with IP addresses of all worker nodes (each in a new line) after the first line of 'Enable Master Disable Aneka'. 
2. If connected to cloud using VPN, add cloud IP addresses in cloud.txt (each in a new line).

Now download the Android/fasthearttest.apk in an android device and enter master IP address to healthcare analysis.
